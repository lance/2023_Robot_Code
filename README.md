* PathPlanner and dynamic trajectory following
* Feedforward and State-Space Control

## Hardware
The robot is a simple differential drive with a 3DOF arm with the following hardware:
* Four Brushless NEO/SparkMax Drivetrain
* NI Roborio controller
* Three Brushless NEO/SparkMax Arm drive
* One Brushed 775/TalonSRX Turret drive
* Dual NEO 550/SparkMax Gripper drive
